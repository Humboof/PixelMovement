# Pixel Movement

This plugin replaces the default grid-based movement in RPG Maker MV with precise, pixel-based movement instead. Additionally this plugin adds full z-depth support, which allows you to have varying terrain heights and create movement to traverse up or down the tileset.

## Installation
